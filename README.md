# TM-Simulator

In this project, the behaviour of a Turing Machine is simulated. The program receives information related to the Turing Machine, such as the number of states, number of final states, and list of transitions. There are three types of tasks which can be performed:
1) Step - returns the TM's configuration after a step
2) Accept - returns True if the TM accepts the word it receives as input
3) k_accepts - returns True if the TM accepts the word it receives as input in k steps
